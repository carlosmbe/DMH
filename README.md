### Introduction
In the digital era, television has evolved into a complex landscape with myriad shows across various genres and streaming platforms. To address the challenge of keeping track of these shows, we propose "Show Tracker," a web application designed to help users organize and manage their TV show interests effectively.

The Web App can be accessed here: 
https://showtracker.streamlit.app

### Project Objective
The goal of "ShowTracker" is to create a web application that allows users to categorize and track TV shows in a personalized manner. The project focuses on utilizing an API to fetch TV show data and store it in a Firebase database, which the web app app will access. This approach ensures real-time data accuracy and enhances the user experience.

### Technical Specifications
1. App Interface:
Platform: Web
Languages: Python


Features:
- Intuitive and engaging user interface
- Categorization of shows (‘Want To Watch,’ ‘Watched,’ All Shows (Haven’t Watched)’)
- Detailed information on TV shows
- Real-time updates from the Firebase database


2. Firebase Database:
Type: Cloud Firestore or Realtime Database
Functionality:
- Store and manage TV show data
- Handle user preferences and data synchronization
- Seamless integration with the web app

3. Python Script for TV Show Data Retrieval:
Language: Python
Frameworks/Libraries: Firebase Admin SDK, requests

### Functionality:
- Fetch TV show data using a reliable API (e.g., IMDb API, TVMaze API)
- Process and structure the data for Firebase compatibility
- Update the Firebase database with new and existing show details


### Project Timeline
Stage 1: Project setup, Firebase configuration, and API selection
Stage 2: Development of the Python script for API data retrieval and Firebase integration
Stage 3: Design and development of the app interface
Stage 4: Integration of the app with the Firebase database and initial testing
Stage 5: Comprehensive testing, debugging, and project presentation


### Conclusion
With Show Tracker, we aim to deliver a dynamic and engaging platform for TV show tracking and management.

This project not only provides the entire team with practical experience in app development and cloud database management but also offers insights into API utilization. Our focus is on creating an application that is both technologically sophisticated and user-friendly, aligning with the needs of modern viewers.
