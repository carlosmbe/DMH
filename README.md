### Introduction
In the digital era, television has evolved into a complex landscape with myriad shows across various genres and streaming platforms. To address the challenge of keeping track of these shows, we propose "ShowTracker," an iOS application designed to help users organize and manage their TV show interests effectively.
### Project Objective
The goal of "ShowTracker" is to create an iOS application that allows users to categorize and track TV shows in a personalized manner. The project focuses on utilizing an API to fetch TV show data and store it in a Firebase database, which the iOS app will access. This approach ensures real-time data accuracy and enhances the user experience.
### Technical Specifications
1. iOS App Interface:
Platform: iOS
Languages: Swift, SwiftUI
Features:
Intuitive and engaging user interface
Categorization of shows (‘Want To Watch,’ ‘Watched,’ ‘Haven’t Watched’)
Detailed information on TV shows
Real-time updates from the Firebase database
2. Firebase Database:
Type: Cloud Firestore or Realtime Database
Functionality:
Store and manage TV show data
Handle user preferences and data synchronization
Seamless integration with the iOS app
3. Python / C++ Script for TV Show Data Retrieval:
Language: Python/C++
Frameworks/Libraries: Firebase Admin SDK, requests
### Functionality:
Fetch TV show data using a reliable API (e.g., IMDb API, TVMaze API)
Process and structure the data for Firebase compatibility
Update the Firebase database with new and existing show details
### Project Timeline
Weeks 1-2: Project setup, Firebase configuration, and API selection
Weeks 3-4: Development of the Python script for API data retrieval and Firebase integration
Weeks 5-6: Design and development of the iOS app interface
Weeks 7-8: Integration of the app with the Firebase database and initial testing
Week 9: Comprehensive testing, debugging, and project presentation
### Conclusion
With "ShowTracker," we aim to deliver a dynamic and engaging platform for TV show tracking and management. This project not only provides practical experience in app development and database management but also offers insights into API utilization. Our focus is on creating an application that is both technologically sophisticated and user-friendly, aligning with the needs of modern viewers.
